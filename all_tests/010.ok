*** Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
*** Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
*** Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
*** And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
*** Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
*** Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
*** The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
*** And on the pedestal, these words appear:
*** My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
*** Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
*** Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
*** Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
*** The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
