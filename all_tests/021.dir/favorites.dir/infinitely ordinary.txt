infinitely ordinary by the wrecks
I remember when I learned how to slow down
You told me nights like these rarely come around
we started dancing on the rocks
we had barely began to talk
we were moving
spilt some henny on your socks
so you ran back up on the rocks
and you threw them
I think I could get used to this
I think I could get used to this life
I think I could get used to this
it’s infinitely ordinary
Why don’t I ever stay home?
Why don’t I ever lay low?
I think I could get used to this
I think I could get used to this life
Why don’t I ever stay home?
Why don’t I ever lay low?
I think I could get used to this
it’s infinitely ordinary
we were laying on the roof
might as well have been on the moon
it was heaven
guess i didn’t see the pool
i was busying looking at you
when I fell in
I think I could get used to this
I think I could get used to this life
I think I could get used to this
it’s infinitely ordinary
Why don’t I ever stay home?
Why don’t I ever lay low?
I think I could get used to this
I think I could get used to this life
Why don’t I ever stay home?
Why don’t I ever lay low?
I think I could get used to this
it’s infinitely ordinary
