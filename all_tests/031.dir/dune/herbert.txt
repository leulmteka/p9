*** The mind can go either direction under stressâ€”toward positive or toward negative: on or off.
*** Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and
*** hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.
*** ~ Frank Herbert, Dune
