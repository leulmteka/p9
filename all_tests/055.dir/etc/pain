*** Armin: I get that it was for the sake of the future you saw with the Attack Titan's ability, but did you absolutely have to beat me up that badly?
*** Was the knee to the stomach really necessary?
*** 
*** Eren: I was doing whatever I could to push you two away.
*** It seemed kinda crazy to me, too.
*** I let myself get carried away.
*** I'm really sorry.
*** 
*** Armin: Don't apologize to me. Apologize to Mikasa.
*** She's the one you hurt with your nonsense.
*** 
*** Eren: Yeah, you're right.
*** 
*** Armin: It was all to push us away,
*** and make us into the heroes who killed you and saved humanity from annihilation?
*** 
*** Eren: That's right. Every surviving human would owe you a debt of gratitude.
*** Island devils who went against the island and stayed true to the path of humanity.
*** It would make you the most respected individuals in the world.
*** 
*** Armin: So you're telling us to protect Paradis from reprisal by the rest of the world,
*** like the Tybur family after the Great Titan War?
*** There's no way we can become heroes, Eren.
*** Sorry to disappoint you, but neither I nor the others intend to play the hero like you want.
*** Where're you going?
*** 
*** Eren: The places we wanted to go.
*** While we walk, I'll tell you...
*** about the Founder Ymir.
*** So this is that "fiery water"?
*** 
*** Armin: It really is flowing like a river.
*** 
*** Eren: Where did I leave off?
*** 
*** Armin: Huh?
*** You said the power of the Titans still exists because the Founder Ymir has continued to obey King Fritz for 2,000 years.
*** 
*** Eren: Right.
*** He burned down her home, killed her parents, and ripped out her tongue, and yet even after attaining godlike power, she remained subservient to him.
*** 
*** Armin: What in the world made her do that?
*** 
*** Eren: There's something I felt when I touched her in the Paths.
*** I couldn't believe it.
*** The Founder Ymir... loved King Fritz.
*** 
*** Armin: What?
*** 
*** Eren: That's what it was that kept Ymir bound, even after 2,000 years.
*** I can't understand the deepest depths of the Founder Ymir's heart.
*** But it was clear that she'd been suffering for the entire 2,000 years.
*** 
*** Eren: She kept searching for someone to release her, and finally, they appeared.
*** That person was Mikasa.
*** 
*** Armin: What?! Did you just say "Mikasa"?!
*** 
*** Eren: I did. So you weren't listening after all.
*** 
*** Armin: I was listening!
*** Why Mikasa?
*** 
*** Eren: Well...
*** Only the Founder Ymir knows that.
*** 
*** Eren: I still don't know what Mikasa did.
*** What I knew for certain is that the outcome Mikasa brought about... is what I kept moving forward to reach.
*** I slaughtered humanity, caused Eldians to kill each other on Paradis, and dragged my dear friends into combat, without ever knowing whether they'd survive.
*** 
*** Armin: That's the future you saw at the medal ceremony...
*** 
*** Eren: Armin, my head has become a total mess.
*** One of the effects of the Founding Titan's power is that there's no "past" or "future."
*** It all exists simultaneously.
*** And so... I had no choice.
*** That day, in that moment, Bertholdt had to stay alive.
*** 
*** Armin: Huh?
*** 
*** Eren: So I... sent it toward my mom and not him.
*** 
*** Armin: Let's go, Eren.
*** 
*** Eren: Okay.
*** 
*** Armin: So, how did it go?
*** 
*** Eren: What do you mean?
*** 
*** Armin: With Mikasa!
*** Do you think she's gonna be able to forget about you and live happily with someone else?
*** The way you wanted.
*** 
*** Eren: Mmh. Dunno.
*** 
*** Eren: Ow...
*** 
*** Armin: The hell kind of answer is that?
*** I still haven't forgiven you!
*** How do you feel about the fact that you ignored Mikasa's feelings?
*** Mikasa risked her life and only ever had eyes for you!
*** Did you think you could just say "forget about me" and that'd be that?!
*** At the very least, Mikasa should forget about a heartbreaker like you and find happiness.
*** Well, she just might find a good guy sooner than you'd think and hit it off with him.
*** 
*** Eren: No... I don't want that!
*** I don't want her to find someone. I want to be her one and only for the rest of my life!
*** And after I die, I want her to be hung up on me for at least ten years!
*** 
*** Armin: Oh... I see...
*** I didn't think you'd say anything that pathetic...
*** 
*** Eren: Don't tell Mikasa any of this.
*** I want her to find happiness. I really do.
*** But I... Ugh, damn it!
*** I don't wanna die.
*** I don't wanna leave Mikasa, or any of you!
*** 
*** Armin: Eren! Let's keep trying! Let's find another way!
*** 
*** Eren: We can't!
*** I'm sure none of them wanted to die, either.
*** And yet... I...
*** Eighty percent.
*** 
*** Armin: What?
*** 
*** Eren: I trample eighty percent of humanity.
*** 
*** Armin: How could you?!
*** Eren! Why?
*** 
*** Eren: I attempt a complete eradication of humanity outside the walls, and all of you stop me.
*** And ultimately, eighty percent die.
*** The world outside the walls drops to the same level of civilization as Paradis.
*** Which means there won't be a one-sided war of reprisal, but this conflict doesn't end.
*** 
*** Armin: What the hell do you mean?
*** Are you trying to say what we've done is all pointless?
*** The massacre hasn't occurred yet! Just stop it!
*** 
*** Eren: I can't.
*** Twenty percent of humanity is all you manage to save.
*** It's already been determined.
*** 
*** Armin: "Been determined"?
*** Didn't you determine it? Didn't you kill them?
*** 
*** Eren: So, so many times I tested it, all to no avail.
*** Things always occurred exactly as I saw in my memories of the future.
*** Armin, it's just as you said.
*** I'm... a slave to freedom.
*** 
*** Armin: This is... absolutely crazy!
*** You're saying... it can't be undone?
*** This can't be!
*** This isn't a solution at all!
*** What, you can't have war if there are no people?
*** It's like a bad joke! Who would take it seriously?
*** Eren, it's true that there's no end in sight for this conflict, and I'm sure the hell we went through has happened over and over.
*** But we need to think that despite it all, one day, we can eventually come to understand one another...
*** And now no one will have any faith, not even in something as small as that!
*** The only lesson they'll be left with...
*** is that they must kill, or be killed.
*** That's all.
*** And you're saying you did all this for us?
*** 
*** Grisha: Eren.
*** That's your name.
*** 
*** Eren: No. I didn't.
*** 
*** Grisha: Eren, you're free.
*** 
*** Eren: I wanted to level everything.
*** I wanted to see this sight.
*** 
*** Armin: Why?
*** 
*** Eren: I don't know why. I just wanted to do it... so very badly.
*** I thought I was doing everything to protect all of you.
*** But Sasha and Hange died because of me, and I wound up putting you in lethal confrontations with Floch.
*** Why... Why did it turn out this way?
*** I finally know.
*** It's because I'm an idiot.
*** A garden-variety idiot who got his hands on power.
*** That's why this resolution was the only possible outcome.
*** That's all there is to it, right?
*** 
*** Armin: I get it.
*** Wanting to erase people from the world...
*** I've felt that way, too.
*** 
*** Eren: Liar. You would neverâ€”
*** 
*** Armin: Nobody would guess it,
*** considering I'm a hero who saved twenty percent of humanity.
*** Still, it was me that showed you the book about the outside world.
*** The one who put the idea of a free, unoccupied world in your head was me.
*** 
*** Eren: What's that?
*** 
*** Armin: So you finally noticed it.
*** It was at our feet the whole time, but you were always looking off into the distance.
*** Thank you, Eren.
*** For showing me what was beyond the walls. For showing me this sight.
*** We did this.
*** So after this we'll be together forever, won't we?
*** 
*** Eren: After this? Where?
*** 
*** Armin: In hell, assuming it exists.
*** We'll suffer for the sin of killing eighty percent of humanity. Together.
*** 
*** Eren: Armin, it's time.
*** I'm erasing your memory of our time here,
*** but once everything is over, you'll remember again.
*** 
*** Armin: I know.
*** Our next meeting will be a fight to the death.
*** And the next one after that...
*** 
*** Eren: Yeah.
*** I'll be waiting for you. In hell.
*** 
*** Armin: Right. We'll be together, forever.
